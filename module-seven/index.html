                        	Escape From Tomorrow follows a man (Roy Abramsohn) and his family as they spend a day at the theme park. Unfortunately, the day turns into a surrealist nightmare as the family dynamic splits and the man becomes interested in two French girls (Annet Mahendru and Danielle Safady). The park attractions and workers turn sinister, but he isn’t sure if it’s actually happening, or if he’s having a mental breakdown.

                       		After originally being set to star Ben Affleck and Kristen Stewart, the upcoming con drama Focus is back in gear with Will Smith and Australian actress Margot Robbie, and now the project has lured a third actor into the fold. Rodrigo Santoro, who is best known for playing Xerxes in Zack Snyder's 300, has come aboard the film and is now set to play one of the principal antagonists.

                            While I still have a strange, unwanted taste in my mouth from hearing about the propose remake of John Hughes’ Weird Science, thanks to the above parody video from Funny or Die I can temporarily forget about it. This video brings to life any conversation that any film fan has had about Weird Science that lasts longer than three minutes.

								<em>Kick-Ass, Hit Girl and Red Mist return for the follow-up to 2010’s irreverent global hit: Kick-Ass 2. After Kick-Ass’ insane bravery inspires a new wave of self-made masked crusaders, led by the badass Colonel Stars and Stripes, our hero joins them on patrol. When these amateur superheroes are hunted down by Red Mist —reborn as The Mother F%&*^r—only the blade-wielding Hit Girl can prevent their annihilation. With graduation looming and uncertain what to do, Dave decides to start the world’s first superhero team with Mindy.</em>

								<em>When a mysterious disc enters the office with the words ‘The Vatican Exorcisms’ printed on it we’re obliged to hit play. When up boots a found footage film set in Italy the age old repetitians of genre favourites come to mind including ‘The Tunnel’ and ‘Episode 50’. A genre that has churned out the same film a hundred times before bringing nothing new but the same mistakes</em>

								<em>While most of the film was fairly effective, Ektra was a little too obvious and too didactic; never taking a moment's pause in driving its point. That said, Ekstra managed to be more than decent mainly because of the brilliant Vilma Santos who was able to take the audience through a gamut of emotions that her character was going through. From her painstaking preparations, the mundane and idle waiting that took up most of her day to her little moments of hope and crushed aspirations, Santos held the audience at the palm of her hands, driving us to feel what her character felt.</em></br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

								<em>Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) s trained by Judith Bolton (Embeth Davidtz) and infiltrates a company run by Wyatt's former mentor, Jock Goddart (Harrison Ford), who stole several of Wyatt's ideas, by providing Goddart with an advanced software able to hack into cellphones, with potential military applications. FBI Agent Gamble (Josh Holloway) interrogates Adam, revealing that three other employees of Wyatt who transferred to Goddart's company were found dead, but Adam ignores him.</em>

								<em>Billy (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) are salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital world. Trying to prove they are not obsolete, they defy the odds by talking their way into a coveted internship at Google, along with a battalion of brilliant college students. But, gaining entrance to this utopia is only half the battle. Now they must compete with a group of the nation's most elite, tech-savvy geniuses to prove that necessity really is the mother of re-invention. (c) Fox</em>
